This project aims at exercising git and the git workflow through github while implementing a real project as a team. 

 

Groups will build an app called EWallet which will have various features to track expenses, income and helps the user plan for purchases. 

I have put together the skeleton for the project in the repo below. Each group should fork the repository and have a separate copy.  

the main 2 classes you will change are:

1- EwalletApp that contains app startup and GUI design in Swing. 

2- A class that implements the Expenser interface.

Feel free to make any additions to classes - i.e. adding variables or supporting functions, but you should not need many.
Changes to existing functions should be discussed with me first. We want to monitor the scope.

Our goal is to work in collaboration to run a full software project

Steps to work on the project:

1- Compile a set of user stories (already written in draft mode in the Expenser interface)

2- Prioritize, organize and classify user stories. 

3- Post those into github as issues 

4- The issues should be under a project under a specialized repository where the group all will work to implement and review 

5- Every issue will have an implementer +  a reviewer from the group

6- implementers will use Egit or command line to push to the group's remote repository on github 

7- Reviewers will use the github to review the code and may choose to test the code locally.

8- Workflow will be agreed upon in class. 

A- Scrum-masters & product owners for the groups will be agreed upon in class 

B- This will include presenting updates, making sure the github project issues are updated and progress is reported. 

C- Every user story will be translated to a git hub issue

D- issues will be organized into milestones (representing sprints)

E- issues will be associated with projects

F- sprint 1 will include fully organized project kanban board and "some features" implemented

G - Pull requests will be used for reviews 

H- branch structure will be used, which branches? up to the group!

I- group is responsible for syncing and communication and collaborative work.  

7- division of user stories should in equal numbers and by agreement.

8- more details will be discussed in class. 

Deliverables:

1- Java project in a github repo. 

2 demo's in class. (Week 6: and Week 7).
